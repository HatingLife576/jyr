          Jyr is a family of operating sytems that either run with the not-yet-made Jyr kernel or the Linux kernel. The family includes Vyx, Dyr, and Jya, with more coming soon. Jyr was built to be simply with ease in mind. Jyr also wants better ways to be awesome. We have plenty of OS's but not enough creativity in them, not enough ideas to make them all more than the same things with different skins. <a href="./family.html">Look at the family of operating systems</a>
